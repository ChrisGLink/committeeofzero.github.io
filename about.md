Imagine, if you will, a world where information flows freely without limits. A world where words, ideas, entertainment, and culture can be spread and understood by all, without barriers imposed by country or language...

If a world like that existed, maybe then people would be able to enjoy Japanese visual novels without having to wait like twelve years for a translation.

Unfortunately, it doesn't. And that's where we come in.

<h3>OUR PURPOSE</h3>

We, The Committee of Zero, exist for the purpose of opening the metaphorical "gate" that separates entertainment of the West and of the East, so that those of the English speaking world may feast. To put that in a way that won't make your eyes melt from the chuunibyou, we translate/port/patch/otherwise modify visual novels from Japan so that English speakers can enjoy them.

Our current priority is 5pb./MAGES.'s Science Adventure (SciADV) series, which consists of a great range of titles including the reason you're probably all here, that being Steins;Gate. However, we intend on bringing as many of them to the English speaking world as we can, so stay tuned for that after we finish our current projects.


<h3>CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR TRANSLATION TALENT!</h3>

If you think you have the skills to translate visual novels to English, but haven't because you don't have the means to actually insert the translations into the VNs, look no further. We sure as hell have those means, and are happy to provide them to anyone who wishes to help our cause.
