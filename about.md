Imagine, if you will, a world where information flows freely without limits. A world where words, ideas, entertainment, and culture can be spread and understood by all, without barriers imposed by country or language...

If a world like that existed, maybe then people would be able to enjoy Japanese visual novels without having to wait like twelve eternities for a translation.

Unfortunately, it doesn't. And that's where we come in.
