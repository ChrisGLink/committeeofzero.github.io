This is a 100% walkthrough for ROBOTICS;NOTES ELITE, designed to allow readers to play through the game in the optimal route order.

<p><i>(Note: route names are abbreviated to avoid spoilers.)</i></p>

<p>Recommended route order is <i>Phase 05 → Phase 06 → Phase 07 → Phase 08 → Phase 09</i>.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the route you get will depend on the <u>replies you choose when Kaito is able to answer certain tweeps.</u></p>

<p>At several points, this guide will ask you to <strong>save</strong>. Please keep track of these saves, as you will need to return to them later.</p>

### Starting off

To avoid making this guide too lengthy but also explain how to get all of the achievements, we will list some general advice for not missing anything: 

* **1)** During the first three phases of the game, you can answer all of the tweeps freely. Akiho's tweeps, however, can be answered freely regardless of what phase you are currently in.
*  **2)** Every time you enter a location you have never seen before, get your PokeCom out and check ‘IRUO.’ to gather as many geotags as possible. You should focus particularly on Kaito's classroom, which has a new geotag every time you enter it.
*  **3)** Don't miss any inputs during quick-time events, unless it is indicated that you should do otherwise.

### Phase 04:

On July 30, at noon and inside the conference room, reply:

* **GEZI-SISTER: What is a titty?**
    *   <i>Reply: A woman’s large breast. Kinda old lingo tho</i>

On July 31, at noon and outside the building you found the first Kimijima Report in, reply:

* **GEZI-SISTER: @UMISHO Boobs, right?**
    * <i>Reply: Yup, that’s it!</i>
* **DAITOKU_JUNJUN: My role keeps getting bigger and bigger. I'm really afraid that maybe it’s not okay for me to be here... People all around me are so talented. I couldn't keep up yesterday either**
    * <i>Reply: You should take a page from Koujiro Frau. Let's both be more bold. You'll feel better after that.</i>
* **FRAUKOUJIRO: Oof, I feel dizzy... Must be because I was pulled out of my room for a long time yesterday. The sunlight is poison to us shut-ins, everyone knows that**
    * <i>Reply: You alright? Please don't go and die on us. That'd suck</i>

On August 1, at noon and inside Kai’s room, reply:

* **FRAUKOUJIRO: The hallway is totally flooded and i keep finding broken glass everywhere. This place really is a shithole. My poor wallet after the repairs is gonna be just as empty as me**
    * <i>Reply: Well at least the atmosphere there is cool. Feels kinda like a secret base. I guess Im just a visitor so I don't worry about the practicality</i>

On August 2, in the morning and on the Old Tanegashima Airport Runway, reply:

* **FRAUKOUJIRO: I have no clothes to go out in. All my clothes are covered in mud from the storm last night** 
    * <i>Reply: Uh, really? Should I bring Aki-chan's old clothes?</i>

At noon, inside the Irei General Store:

* **GEZI-SISTER: What is a “Gunbam”?**
    * <i>Reply: Something Aki-chan likes</i>
    
On August 5, in the morning at the Robot Clinic, reply:

* **GEZI-SISTER: What are fireworks? I couldn’t see them**
    * <i>Reply: It's a big, colorful thing that makes a loud sound. It's very pretty</i>

On August 7, after Kaito goes shopping with Junna, when you’re on the Old Tanegashima Airport Runway, reply:

* **GEZI-SISTER: @UMISHO What is Space Candy?**
    * <i>Reply: Tasty mint candy</i>

Immediately before the GunBuild-1 assembly is complete, when you’re still on the runway:

* **FRAUKOUJIRO: bleeh, my eyelids are so heavy... is it bc I haven't slept? bc im too turned on? were there too many hot guys that I was panting over? i don't really have anything to do, but i havent slept for almost 3 days now and now im 2 horny 2 sleep...**
    * <i>Reply: You’ll get sick if you keep on doing that</i>

On August 10, in the evening, in front of the hangar, reply:

* **DAITOKU_JUNJUN: I was no help at all today. I'm the lowest of the low. They picked me, and I ran away... I'd lost the fight before it even began. I've just been hurting myself by pretending. I kept on ignoring all the frustration and shame in my heart... and I've just kept doing that over and over**
    * <i>Reply: Ask yourself why you keep doing it. If you don't figure that out, you'll never change. You've got this!</i>

### Phase 05:

On August 13, at noon, outside the museum, reply:

* **FRAUKOUJIRO: My head itches... A lot, but i know the reason tho. it's bc I haven't taken a bath in like 3 days, duhuhu**
    * <i>Reply: At least take baths. I can't work with you like that</i>

At sunset, at the park:

* **GEZI-SISTER: What is a “cannon”?**
    * <i>Reply: Aki-chan said it's a gun that you carry on your shoulder</i>

On August 18, in the morning, in front of the hangar, reply:

* **FRAUKOUJIRO: I just noticed that I haven't cut my hair in over a year, buuut im just gonna leave it that way. eeyup**
    * <i>Reply: There are salons on the island so maybe get it cut? No wait, you’d be miserable at a place like that, huh</i>
* **GEZI-SISTER: What is a “Boltvalian”?**
    * <i>Reply: A power-type robot in Kill-Ballad</i>

On August 19, at noon, inside the conference room, reply:

* **GEZI-SISTER: @UMISHO What is a pervert?**
    * <i>Reply: Someone like Koujiro Frau</i>

On August 20, before the battle, in Frau’s room, reply:

* **DAITOKU_JUNJUN: I couldn't keep up with the conversation at all yesterday. Thinking again about why I'm here...**
    * <i>Reply: Aki-chan said we'd build it together, remember? Of course you belong here</i>


<u>At the start of August 23rd, create <b>SAVE 01</b> and <b>lock</b> it.</u> When you need to save your game, use a different save slot.

    * <i>Reply: @FRAUKOUJIRO You should ask Madam President for help. She can take out 10-20 bugs at a time with just her bare hands</i>

At noon, do not reply to any tweeps, or you will be locked out of an extra scene.

When the search for the report begins, travel to the Robot Clinic, and reply to Frau:

On November 19, at Akiho’s house, reply:

* **GEZI-SISTER: @UMISHO Do you like women's breasts, Big Brother? How about ones that are underdeveloped? Are they acceptable even if they have no hope of growth?**
    * <i>Reply: Flat is justice. As it is written in the sacred texts</i>

On November 20, in front of the Old Airport Hotel, a.k.a. Frau’s house, reply:

* **GEZI-SISTER: @UMISHO What do you think about being called “Big Brother” by me? Shall I change it to “Big Bro” or “Broski” or “Bro-Bro?” Or rather, I can copy myself 12 times and each one could call you something different. Standing by.**
    * <i>Reply: Big Brother's fine</i>

When you’re inside Frau’s house, reply:

* **GEZI-SISTER: @UMISHO If Big Brother was able to choose my outfit, what would you like it to be? No matter what you answer, there will be no DLC added. Even if someone were to offer to pay for it, there still would be no additions. Especially if they're sexual in nature.**
    * <i>Reply: How about a cat-ear maid? Give it a chance</i>
  
On November 21, as soon as you can, reply:

* **GEZI-SISTER: @UMISHO If you could use me for anything, what would you do? Would you use me for pleasure?**

<u>On November 28, check your tweeps for a surprise.</u>

### Phase 08:

After you get Phase 07’s ending, load **SAVE 01**. Open Twipo right away and reply:

    * <i>Reply: Have you gone before? I heard that it's a no newcomers allowed event. Is that true?</i>

On December 19, at Uchugaoka Park, reply:

* **FRAUKOUJIRO: @UMISHO Its not a playground, its a battlefield. and theres way 2 many people tbh. In the summer, you have to wait in line for hours under the blazing sun. strong memories of waiting for 4 hrs for major booths. there was one time wen even tho the old man next to me was basically shitting himself, i had to just deal with it to stay in line**
    * <i>Reply: Wow. So people just power through it and no one complains?</i>

On December 23, in front of Kaito’s house and before you look for the Kimijima report, reply:

* **FRAUKOUJIRO: @UMISHO Current attendance for Day 1 of ComiMa is about 300k. 3 years ago, the holy lands where it’s held were expanded and it turned to chaos after that. About 30% travel from overseas. btw the people from the countryside have rly intense eyes**
    * <i>Reply: How did you live through such a battlefield...</i>

<u>On December 27, check your tweeps for a surprise.</u>

### Phase 09:

Depending on what you choose to do at a certain point in this Phase, you may encounter a bad end. If you do, use the “Daily Records” feature to go back and do the opposite of what you first did.
If you reach the end of Phase 09 without getting the bad ending, you might be interested in going back to see it. If so, save your game where you are at, and use the "Daily Records" feature to go back and do the opposite of what you first did.


### Phase 12:

When you arrive at TNSC, create **SAVE 03** and <u><b>lock</b></u> your save. Try to save semi-frequently after this. Every ten or fifteen minutes should be fine.

When you reach a set of input prompts, get one of them wrong. View the ending, then load your last save. At the final prompt, reload **SAVE 03**, and don’t get any prompts wrong this time. Read to the end.
